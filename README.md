<h3> What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h3>
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention.
<h3> Goal of the project</h3>
The goal is to provide a free preliminary diagnostic tool that can aid parents in their decision to pursue further ASD testing.
<h3>Why this is important?</h3>
Approximately 25% of children with autism are undiagnosed. Diagnosing ASD is a complicated and expensive process that not every family can go through. Getting the right kids to the right specialists is crucial to reducing the number of undiagnosed children and the burden on families.
